I've come to a point where I can't trust MyCpp anymore. I have also sketched
new code guidelines to which MyCpp does not adhere. Therefore, I need a new
base library, which would also serve as a testbed for my ideas on Mt language
extensions.

If Mt translator will be implemented, then libmary will be the library which
will be called by Mt language constructs. Therefore, libmary is meant to be
really minimalistic: it is just about basic multithreading. General-purpose
library on top of libmary will be called "libmess".

The first project that will use libmary as a core library will be Momentvideo
video server.
